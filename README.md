# Calculator Programs

This repository contains two versions of a simple calculator program written in Python:

---

## 1. GUI Calculator using Tkinter

**Description:**

This is a basic calculator application built using Python's `Tkinter` library for graphical user interfaces. The program provides a clean and interactive interface similar to a traditional calculator. It includes a display area for user input and output, and buttons for digits (0â€“9), arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`), a clear button (`C`), and an equals button (`=`).

Users can perform basic arithmetic operations by clicking on the buttons, and the result is displayed in real time when the equal button is pressed. Error handling is included for invalid operations like division by zero.

**Key Features:**
- Graphical interface using Tkinter
- Real-time input and result display
- Arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide, modulus
- Error handling with pop-up messages
- Easy to use, responsive layout

## 2. Console-based Calculator (Without Tkinter)

**Description:**

This is a simple command-line calculator built using Python. The program runs in the terminal and prompts the user to choose an arithmetic operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, or Modulus) from a menu. After selecting an operation, the user is asked to input two numbers. The program then performs the selected operation and prints the result.

If the user enters invalid data or attempts a division/modulus by zero, appropriate error messages are shown. This version does not use any graphical libraries and runs purely in the console.

**Key Features:**
- Simple text-based interface
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, %
- Error handling for division by zero and invalid input
- Uses `input()` and `print()` for interaction
- Lightweight and easy to run in any terminal
